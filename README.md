    <font size="3" color="black" face="Arial">At present a great deal of the work force of most countries is engaged 
    in creating, processing, storing, communicating and just working with information. Computers have become commonplace in homes, offices, stores, schools, research institutes, plants.
    The use of computers in business, industry and communication services is 
    widespread today. Computer- controlled robots are able to improve the quality of manufactured products and to increase the productivity of industry. Computers can control the work of power stations, plants and docks. They help in making different decisions and in management of economy.
    The work of banks depends upon computer terminals for millions of daily 
    operations. Without these terminals, records of deposits and withdrawals would be difficult to maintain, and it would be impossible to make inquiries about the current status of customer accounts.
    Computers form a part of many military systems including communication and fire control. They are applied for automatic piloting and automatic navigation. Space exploration depends on computers for guidance, on-board environment and research.
    Computers find application in astronomy and upper atmosphere
     research. Weather forecasting, library information services can benefit from computers too.
    It is interesting to note that computers are widely used in 
    medicine. They became valuable medical diagnostic tools. 
    Computers are used for optical scanning and image processing, ranging from pattern recognition to image processing. Technicians can operate computer tomography scanners which combine x-rays with computer technology to give sectional views of the body of patients. 
    The views then can be combined into a single image shown on the screen. </p></em></center> </text-shadow>
